  datachipText: "Java is:\n\nObject Oriented: In Java, everything is an Object. Java
    can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model. \r\n\nPlatform
    Independent: Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when
    Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into
    platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and
    interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run
    on. \r\n"
