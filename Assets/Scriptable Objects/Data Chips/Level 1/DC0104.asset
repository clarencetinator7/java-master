  datachipText: "Simple: Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand
    the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master. \r\nSecure: With Java's
    secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication
    techniques are based on public-key encryption. \r\n\nArchitecture-neutral: Java
    compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the
    compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime
    system. \r\nPortable: Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation
    dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java
    is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
