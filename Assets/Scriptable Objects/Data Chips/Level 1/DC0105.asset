  datachipText: "Robust: Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations
    by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking. \r\n\nMultithreaded:
    With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform
    many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct
    interactive applications that can run smoothly. \r\n\nInterpreted: Java byte
    code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored
    anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking
    is an incremental and light-weight process. \r\n"
