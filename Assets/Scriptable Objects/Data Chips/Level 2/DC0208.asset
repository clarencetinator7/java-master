  datachipText: "Java Variables\r\n\nA variable is a place where the program stores
    data temporarily. As the name implies the value stored in such a location can
    be changed while a program is executing (compare with constant).\r\n\r\nIn Java,
    there are different types of variables, for example:\r\n\nString - stores text,
    such as \"Hello\". String values are surrounded by double quotes\r\n\nint - stores
    integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123\r\n\nfloat -
    stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99\r\n\nchar
    - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by
    single quotes\r\n\nboolean - stores values with two states: true or false\r"
